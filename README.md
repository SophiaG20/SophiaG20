A little about me:

## My grandpa was a design engineer @ NASA for everything before (1950's) and up until the 90's for what is known as "first humans on the moon..". I hope to bring that energy to Web3.
Talks about #web3, #womanveterans, and #cryptocurrency
 - Additionally, I am a beta tester for both AI coding and AI text usage. 
 - I believe that diversity is important and that everyone should be treated with respect.
 - I listen to YouTube music and some Apple music, looking for new music suggestions.
 - Either listening to ADHD chill music or Queens of the Stone Age or The Strokes.
