This spot is reserved for things that I am thinking about and doing in between the time I failed 201 and the future of CodeFellows

# the begining 

## SO I moved into Microsofts backyard and pulled out the old (2020) Windows computer and found it to be an absolute mess

### I have mental health issues so the move from Seattle, and emergency with puppy needing surgery and changing jobs did not help with CodeFellows

## That aside, it has been really excellent to take a breather and sort through my things and set up this bas a$$ tech corner in my room

# What is next Sophia G20?

***Help my web3 group how to code***

***Help Thompson or at least follow her and her sad bunni3s***
